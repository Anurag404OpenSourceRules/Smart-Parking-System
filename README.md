# Smart-Parking-System
- Requires [**Python**](https://www.python.org/) to be installed on the system with [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) library. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) has been used for Database. <br>
```pip install opencv-python```

- [Pytesseract](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/) is needed to be installed on the system. <br>
```pip install pytesseract```

- A **Web-cam** is needed to test the system.
- For better results, it is suggested to get a **good quality camera** with a few changes in the code, if it is desired to be implemented in a project.
